# 👋 Hi! I'm Samuel Gutiérrez

## 🎓 Artificial Intelligence student at the University of Santiago de Compostela (USC).

I am particularly interested in **Computer Vision**, **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning**, as well as the application of **data-driven methods** to real-world problems.  
Most of my projects focus on object detection, model training and inference pipelines, and working with structured datasets.

Here you can find academic projects and experiments related to AI and data.
